# **Terry's Golf Society Responsive Website Project.**

## *What does it do and what need does it fulfil?*

This project uses skills learnt to build a mobile-first responsive 
website for a Golf Society. It fulfils the need for members and potential
members to view upcoming outings, recent results and news about golfing
holidays. The site will also allow the viewer watch videos and view 
fellow members in action. You will also be able to join the society
using a pop up modal and also a contact enquire form on a contact page.

## *Functionality of project.*

The website is fully responsive. It is a four page website with the navigation 
buttons visible on all pages to help the user go from page to page. 
The 'Join our Society here!' modal is on all pages to entice potential members
to sign up. 
The form on the contact page is not fully functional in that it doesn't alert 
anyone from the Webteam that a form has being filled nor does it fill a 
database.
All social icons are functional and direct the user to three different 
pages. 

## *UX*

This website is designed with the members of the Golf Society in mind. 
Mobile first design was important as members could check upcoming outings
and results on their mobiles as soon as the round was finished.

including User Stories, wireframes, mockups, diagrams that I created as part 
of the design process.
