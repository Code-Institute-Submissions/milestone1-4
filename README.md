# **Terry's Golf Society Responsive Website Project.**

## *What does it do and what need does it fulfil?*

This project uses skills learnt to build a mobile-first responsive 
website for a Golf Society. It fulfils the need for members and potential
members to view upcoming outings, recent results and news about golfing
holidays. The site will also allow the viewer watch videos and view 
fellow members in action. You will also be able to join the society
using a pop up modal and also a contact enquire form on a contact page.

## *Functionality of project.*

The website is fully responsive. It is a four page website with the navigation 
buttons visible on all pages to help the user go from page to page. 
Instead of using Media Queries I decided to use Bootstraps
responsive grid system.
The 'Join our Society here!' modal is on all pages to entice potential members
to sign up. 
The form on the contact page is not fully functional in that it doesn't alert 
anyone from the Webteam that a form has being filled nor does it fill a 
database.
All social icons are functional and direct the user to three different 
pages. 

## *UX*

This website is designed with the members of the Golf Society in mind. 
Mobile first design was important as members could check upcoming outings
and results on their mobiles as soon as the round was finished. 

Click on the directory 'user-design-experience' for all the Planes, 
including User Stories, wireframes, mockups, diagrams that I created as part 
of the design process.

## *Technologies Used*

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap
* Bash
* Ubuntu
* GIT
* GITHUB
* Google Chrome developer tools
* Cloud 9 IDE
* Javascript and JQuery are imported for the join the society modal.

## *Deployment*

1. The Website was coded in Cloud 9 IDE. 
1. A local GIT directory was used for version control. 
1. It was then uploaded to GITHUB using Ubuntu / Bash script. 
    * git add . (Adds files to be committed)
    * git commit -m "Initial commit" (for first commit and every other commit 
      thereafter a comment about what was changed ie. 
      "Updated footer in index.html")
    * git push (This command is used to upload local repository content
      to a remote repository.)
    * Input username and password (Once this is done correctly all files will 
       be available in the software delevopment platform GITHUB)
    
1. Once in a GITHUB repositories it was made live using GITHUB Pages. 

The website can be found at: https://darrenmcgill35.github.io/milestone1/

## *Testing*

Each page was tested locally and on GITHUB pages using Chrome developer tools, 
testing its functionality as well as look and feel
(in landscape and portrait mode) on Galaxy S5, S6, S8, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, 
iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad, iPad Pro and responsive desktop. 
All links were tested along with uploaded videos. The modal and contact
