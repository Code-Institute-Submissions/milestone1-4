# **Terry's Golf Society Responsive Website Project.**

## *What does it do and what need does it fulfil?*

     This project uses skills learnt to build a mobile-first responsive Website for a Golf Society.
     It fulfils the need for members and potential members to view upcoming outings, recent results and news about golfing holidays. 
     The site will also allow the viewer watch videos and view fellow members in action. 
     You will also be able to join the society using a pop up modal and also a contact enquire from on a contact page.
